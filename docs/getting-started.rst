Open the preferences for the app.

On MacOS, open the Solar Sails menu, then click Preferences.

SunVox tab
----------

The first workspace path listed in this tab will be used for reading/writing SunVox clipboard files.

Click the ``[+]`` button at the bottom.

Navigate to, then choose, the folder containing your SunVox app.

SunVox and Solar Sails both use this location to store SunVox clipboard data.

Audio tab
---------

This tab is not yet functional.

For audio playback, Solar Sails will use the default system output device at the time of application launch.

MIDI tab
--------

Solar Sails will listen to MIDI note and CC events.

MIDI listening is omnichannel.

Interfaces
..........

Available MIDI interfaces are listed here.

Solar Sails will listen only to selected interfaces.

Click on an interface to select or deselect it.

If you connect an interface while Solar Sails is running, click Refresh.
If an interface was selected in the past, it will be automatically reselected.

Ignore MIDI in background
.........................

Turn this on if you want Solar Sails to ignore MIDI events when in the background.

CC Mappings
...........

This is a list of CCs that will be auto-assigned to controllers in the :doc:`mmck`.

The format is ``###=Label``.
``###`` is the decimal notation of the CC to listen to.
``Label`` is how you want the CC to be labeled in the user interface.
